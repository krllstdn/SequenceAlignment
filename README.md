# ðŸ§¬ Sequence Alignment: Global and Local

This repo contains two Python implementations of sequence alignment algorithms:

- **Global alignment** (Needlemanâ€“Wunsch)
- **Local alignment** (Smithâ€“Waterman)

These algorithms are used to align DNA (or protein) sequences to find similarities.

## What it does
- Aligns two sequences using dynamic programming
- Lets you set match/mismatch scores and gap penalty
- Shows alignment results and scores
- Optional: prints the scoring matrix and the path used to trace the alignment
